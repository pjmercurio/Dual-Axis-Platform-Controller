## Building & Running

The app can be run by simply running `./run.sh` from the root folder. This will handle installing dependencies and creating a virtual environment. URLs to access the webapp will be printed to the console.

To build the standalone app, run `./build.sh`. This will first compile the Flask app and its associated static assets into a binary, then this binary is copied into the Electron app's dist folder, where the Electron app is then build with the Flask binary as a bundle resource. The final product ends up in the root build folder as a standalone app which when opened will spin up the Flask server, check for a serial connection with the controller board, and get the urls for opening the web app, displaying them in the main window.
